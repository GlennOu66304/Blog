jQuery CDN hosted by Google
In the same way we can use jQuery CDN hosted by Google, as shown below:

```
<head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

jQuery CDN hosted by Microsoft
Microsoft also hosts jQuery and this CDN is used below:

```
<head>
    <script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

jQuery CDN hosted by CloudFlare
CloudFlare is a great CDN and also very popular too. It also has jQuery CDN which you can use in your website.

```
<head>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

##### 3.Play around with the jQuery:

1.First download the code project from the CodePen. if you have question about this process, please go to [2020.08.07 Code pen and React Coding Learnning](http://glennou.cn/2020/08/07/React-Learning/)to get instructions.  
2. First remove the "src fold" and disc fold,and add "js" fold and "css" fold into the subfold under the main fold "getting-started-with-jquery". at the same time, you need to put the style.css file into css and put "script.js" into js fold.  
3. change the css code into

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```

in the index.html.

4.change the js code to

```
<script  src="js/script.js"></script>
```

##### 4.apply the jQuery grammr into the code

```
$(document).ready(function(){

    $("h3").click(function(){
        $("button").hide();
    });

});
```

above code said that select the H3 paragraph and click it,
it will generate a new functon: to select the"button" and hide this button.  
Utilize the $ to select the product, and assing certain product.
