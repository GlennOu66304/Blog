# Typora css debug

You could open the dev tool inside of the typora, then inspect the element. 

choose the css tag, also find the value you want to change(You could do it by google search or test it), then decide the value.



Then go to the themme folder (Prefernece--> Appearence) , to open the css file in the vs code to change it, no need to relaunch the Typora editor.





## Typora media resource insert

Logic

build a assets folder in the root folder, and put the sub project folder  for storing the media file, then use the path in the  git hub md file



vs code find the folder, drag the asset from icloud or taio to the github, then upload the file as well
